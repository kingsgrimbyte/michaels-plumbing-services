  "body": " <p class='mb-4'>Plumbing issues rarely fix themselves. From slow drains and hidden leaks to aging water heaters, choosing the right service at the right time protects your home, your water quality, and your wallet. As water costs rise and building codes evolve, U.S. homeowners are prioritizing preventive maintenance and efficient upgrades more than ever.</p> <p class='mb-4'>In this blog, the team at <strong>Michaels Plumbing Services</strong> breaks down the five most requested plumbing services across the USA\u2014what they solve, when you need them, and how to get the best value.</p> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>What Are the Most Requested Plumbing Services in the USA?</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>These core services address the majority of residential plumbing needs and can prevent costly water damage when handled promptly.</p> <h3 class='text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2'><strong>1) Drain Cleaning and Hydro Jetting</strong></h3> <p class='mb-4'>Hair, grease, soap scum, food particles, and scale build-up are the usual culprits behind slow or blocked drains. Professional drain cleaning starts with augering or snaking and, when needed, escalates to hydro jetting\u2014high-pressure water streams that clear stubborn clogs and scour pipe walls for longer-lasting results.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Best For</strong>: Recurring clogs in kitchen, bath, main line backups, and homes with mature trees whose roots intrude into sewer lines.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Hydro jetting is not ideal for severely damaged or collapsed pipes; a camera inspection is recommended first.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Pro Insight</strong>: Schedule preventative cleaning annually if you use a garbage disposal frequently or have older cast iron lines.</p>     </li> </ul> <h3 class='text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2'><strong>2) Leak Detection and Repair</strong></h3> <p class='mb-4'>Hidden leaks waste water and can cause mold, warped flooring, and structural problems. Modern leak detection uses acoustic listening devices, infrared imaging, and pressure testing to pinpoint the source with minimal wall or slab disruption.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Best For</strong>: Unexplained high water bills, musty odors, warm spots on floors (possible slab leak), or visible ceiling stains.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Delayed repairs increase restoration costs. Minor pinhole leaks in copper often indicate systemic corrosion.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Pro Insight</strong>: Install smart leak sensors near water heaters, washing machines, and under sinks to catch small leaks early.</p>     </li> </ul> <h3 class='text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2'><strong>3) Water Heater Repair and Replacement (Tank &amp; Tankless)</strong></h3> <p class='mb-4'>Most tank water heaters last 8\u201312 years, while tankless models can exceed 15\u201320 years with proper maintenance. Common fixes include replacing thermostats, elements, anode rods, gas control valves, or descaling tankless heat exchangers. When replacement makes more sense, upgrading to high-efficiency or tankless can reduce energy use and deliver endless hot water.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Best For</strong>: Inconsistent hot water, rumbling tanks, rusty water, or visible leaks at the base of the unit.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: DIY installs risk code violations, gas leaks, or improper venting. Professional sizing and permitting are essential.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Pro Insight</strong>: Flush tank models annually to remove sediment; descale tankless units per manufacturer specs to maintain efficiency.</p>     </li> </ul> <h3 class='text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2'><strong>4) Pipe Repair and Whole-Home Repiping</strong></h3><img src='/plumber-replacing-copper-pipes.jpg' alt='plumber-replacing-copper-pipes' class='h-28 w-full rounded-md object-cover my-4' /> <p class='mb-4'>Aging galvanized steel, polybutylene, or corroded copper can lead to low pressure, discolored water, and frequent leaks. Spot repairs address isolated issues, while whole-home repiping replaces problem materials with modern PEX or Type L copper for reliability and better flow.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Best For</strong>: Homes with repeated leaks, brittle pipes, or plumbing installed before the 1990s using outdated materials.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Repiping is a larger project that may require brief water shutoffs and minor drywall access and patching.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Pro Insight</strong>: Consider a home run (manifold) PEX system for balanced pressure and easier future maintenance.</p>     </li> </ul> <h3 class='text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2'><strong>5) Fixture Installation and Water-Saving Upgrades</strong></h3> <p class='mb-4'>New faucets, low-flow toilets, shower valves, garbage disposals, and touchless fixtures improve comfort and reduce water use. Professional installation ensures proper shutoffs, secure mounting, correct trap and venting, and code-compliant connections.</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Best For</strong>: Bathroom and kitchen remodels, persistent drips, or upgrading to EPA WaterSense-certified fixtures.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Cheap fixtures often have plastic internals that wear quickly. Invest in reputable brands with readily available parts.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Pro Insight</strong>: Pair fixture upgrades with supply line and shutoff valve replacements to prevent future leaks.</p>     </li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>Choosing the Right Plumber: Factors to Consider</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Beyond price, the right partner protects your home and delivers lasting value. Look for:</p> <ul class='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Licensing &amp; Insurance</strong>: Verify state licensing, bonding, and general liability/worker\u2019s comp coverage.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Ask if they use camera inspections, pressure testing, and moisture meters for accurate problem solving.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Transparent Pricing</strong>: Get written estimates with scope, materials, and warranties spelled out before work begins.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Response Time</strong>: 24/7 emergency support matters when a burst pipe or failed water heater can\u2019t wait.</p>     </li>     <li class='mb-2'>         <p><strong>Warranties</strong>: Compare parts and labor coverage and ask how warranty claims are handled.</p>     </li> </ul> <h2 class='text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4'><strong>Make an Informed Decision for Your Home</strong></h2> <p class='mb-4'>Whether you\u2019re dealing with a clogged main line, a failing water heater, or mystery moisture under the sink, prompt, professional service prevents larger repairs and preserves home value. The five services above cover the problems most homeowners face\u2014and the ones most likely to cause costly damage if ignored.</p> <p class='mb-4'>Ready for expert help?
